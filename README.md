# Lab 41

This repository is dedicated to creating a progressive web application

For the first part of the build-out, the following will need to be completed:

- PWA Installable
- Accesses a device feature
- Responsive layout

Technical requirements are as follows: 

- Use at least 1 "native" device feature (Contacts, Camera, GPS, etc)
- High Fidelity Styling and UX
  - Good starting points:
    - Pico CSSLinks to an external site.
    - Jiffies CSSLinks to an external site.
- Installable on mobile or web
- Works offline

Idea: Safety focused application that sends a push notification with your location to emergency contact/friends
